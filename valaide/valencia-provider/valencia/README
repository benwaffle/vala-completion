Valencia
--------

* Introduction

Valencia is a gedit plugin that turns gedit into a lightweight IDE for Vala.
Using Valencia, you can easily browse between symbols in a Vala program.  You
can build a Vala program inside gedit and can easily jump to lines with
build errors. You can also get tooltips for methods and get autocompletion 
suggestions by invoking autocomplete in the appropriate context.

* Installation & Licensing

Please consult the INSTALL and COPYING files for more information.
    
* Quick Start

Build Valencia and enable it in gedit as described in the INSTALL file.  If all
Vala source files in your project are contained in a single directory and that
directory has a Makefile, Valencia will work with no extra configuration.  If
your project has multiple directory levels, you'll need to ensure that the
top directory contains either a file named configure.ac, a file named 
configure.in or a Makefile containing the line BUILD_ROOT = 1; this is how 
Valencia identifies the project root.

To use Valencia, place the cursor on any symbol in a Vala file and press F12
to jump to its definition.  Press Alt+Left to return to where the cursor was
before you pressed F12.  To build your project, choose Project->Build or type
Shift+Ctrl+B.  To jump to a line with a build error, simply double-click
the error in the build output.

To get a tooltip for a method, press Ctrl+Space anywhere inside of a method 
call. To invoke autocomplete on a symbol, press Ctrl+Space on any word. If you 
are inside a method call, and want to get autocomplete, press Ctrl+Space twice, 
once to get a tooltip, then again to get the autocomplete list.

The symbol browser lists symbols only in your project. It looks within local
namespaces to find all top-level symbols. To search for a symbol, choose 
Search->Find Symbol... or press Ctrl+Alt+S to go to the search entry, where
you can type the name of the symbol to which you want to find.
