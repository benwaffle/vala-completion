Valencia Installation
---------------------

To build and install Valencia, type the following commands:

    $ make
    $ make install

Do *not* make install as root; Valencia installs in your ~/.gnome2/gedit 
directory, and if you install as root the file permissions will be wrong.

To enable Valencia in gedit, select Edit->Preferences and the click on the 
Plugins tab. Find Valencia in the plugin list and check its checkbox, then click
Close.
